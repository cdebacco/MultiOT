# MultiOT
Optimal transport on Multilayer networks

Python implementation of the MultiOT algorithm described in:

- [1] Ibrahim, A.A.; Lonardi, A.; De Bacco, C. (2021). *Optimal transport in multilayer networks*.  

This is a an algorithm that uses optimal transport theory to find optimal path trajectories in multilayer networks. 

If you use this code please cite [1].
